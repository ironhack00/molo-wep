        "tiempo-desarrollo": {
          "question": "How long does it take to develop a professional website?",
          "answer": "Time varies depending on project complexity. A simple landing page can be ready in 2-3 weeks, a corporate site with 5-10 pages takes 4-6 weeks, and a complete online store may require 8-12 weeks. We include design, development, review and optimization phases. We provide a detailed timeline from the start so you know exactly what to expect at each stage."
        },
        "costo-mantenimiento": {
          "question": "Do I need to pay monthly maintenance for my website?",
          "answer": "It depends on your needs. Hosting and domain have standard annual costs ($100-300 USD/year). Technical maintenance (security updates, plugins, backups) is optional but recommended ($50-150 USD/month). If your site requires frequent content updates, design changes or priority support, we offer maintenance plans that include these services plus monthly development hours."
        },
        "cms-editar": {
          "question": "Will I be able to edit my site's content myself after delivery?",
          "answer": "Absolutely. All our sites include an intuitive administration panel (CMS) where you can edit texts, add images, create new pages and update content without programming. Additionally, we train you in a 1-2 hour session so you master all functions. For more complex design or structure changes, you can always count on our technical support."
        },
        "responsive-mobile": {
          "question": "Will the website look good on phones and tablets?",
          "answer": "Yes, we design with a mobile-first approach. This means your site adapts perfectly to any device (phone, tablet, laptop, desktop) without losing functionality or aesthetics. Over 70% of users browse from mobile, which is why we especially optimize the mobile experience: loading speed, touch navigation, accessible buttons and well-distributed content. We test on multiple devices before delivery."
        },
        "seo-posicionamiento": {
          "question": "Will my website appear on Google automatically?",
          "answer": "Yes, but ranking well requires continuous work. We deliver your site with optimized technical SEO: clean code, fast speed, sitemap, meta tags, and correct structure. This provides the foundation for Google to index you. However, appearing in top results requires content strategy, keyword research, link building and continuous optimization. We offer monthly SEO services if you're looking for competitive positioning in your industry."

        "presupuesto-meta": {
          "question": "What is the recommended minimum budget for a Meta (Facebook/Instagram) advertising campaign?",
          "answer": "We recommend a minimum budget of $500-$1,000 USD monthly for effective Meta Ads campaigns. This amount allows Meta's algorithm to collect enough data to optimize your ads, perform A/B tests and reach your target audience consistently. With lower budgets, the campaign may take longer to generate measurable results and limits segmentation and optimization options."
        },
        "resultados-tiempo": {
          "question": "How long does it take to see results with a digital marketing strategy?",
          "answer": "First performance indicators usually appear in 2-4 weeks, but solid and consistent results are generally observed between 3-6 months. Digital marketing is a continuous optimization process: the first 30 days are dedicated to data collection, the next 60 days to adjustment and optimization, and from the third month is when results consolidate. Patience and constant analysis are key to long-term success."
        },
        "google-vs-meta": {
          "question": "Is it better to invest in Google Ads or Meta Ads for my business?",
          "answer": "It depends on your goals and type of business. Google Ads is ideal for capturing existing demand (people already searching for your product/service), while Meta Ads works better for generating demand and creating awareness. The most effective is usually a combined strategy: use Google Ads for high-intent direct conversions and Meta Ads to build audience, remarketing and engagement. We analyze your specific case to determine the best budget distribution between both platforms."
        },
        "roi-medicion": {
          "question": "How is return on investment (ROI) measured in digital marketing?",
          "answer": "We measure ROI through multiple metrics: cost per acquisition (CPA), customer lifetime value (LTV), conversion rate, and return on ad spend (ROAS). We implement tracking pixels, configure Analytics conversions, and generate detailed monthly reports that show exactly how many leads, sales or valuable actions each dollar invested generated. Full transparency in metrics is essential to demonstrate the real impact of each campaign."
